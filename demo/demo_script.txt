Hello, this is a demo of MindMate Harmony Space.

MindMate is an AI-powered mental wellbeing assistant built using the Jac programming language.

In this demo, a user submits a short description of how they are feeling.
The system logs this input as a mood node inside a graph structure.

A separate emotion analysis agent then classifies the mood as positive, neutral, or negative.

Based on this classification, a feedback agent generates empathetic suggestions
designed to support emotional wellbeing.

All interactions are modeled using an OSP graph, allowing the system to track
emotional patterns over time.

This architecture demonstrates how Jac can be used to build intelligent,
agent-driven wellbeing applications.

Thank you.
